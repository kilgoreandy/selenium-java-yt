Use Fig 2.1 from the text as the basis of your solution to the assignment. Note that, for the purposes of this course, all classes are defined within the default package (in other words, they do not explicitly specify a package).

This assignment must be submitted as a .zip file containing only your solution's .java files named following the convention LastnameFirstInitialExercise#.zip where the '#' is the Exercise number.
For example, my submission for this assignment would be named DukeGExerciseX.zip). There should be NO DIRECTORIES within the zip file.

Inclusion of the System.exit() method in your code negatively impacts the operation of the test suite and will result in a loss of credit. DO NOT use the System.exit() method in your solution.

Template code will normally be provided, but was omitted in this case because the full source of the program appears in Fig 2.1 of the text. The unit test driver I'll use to grade your assignment (Welcome1Testv3.java) has also been made available. Please use that to check your assumptions and validate your work.
